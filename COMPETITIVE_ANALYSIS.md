# EPI-Q Competitive Analysis & Strategic Positioning
**Analysis Date:** November 2025  
**Market:** Enterprise Process Mining & Task Mining (Unified Platform)

---

## Executive Summary

EPI-Q is positioned as the **first unified task mining + process mining platform with AI-powered digital twin capabilities**, targeting regulated mid-to-large enterprises seeking complete end-to-end process visibility without tool sprawl or costly implementation services. 

**Core Positioning:** Most competitors force you to buy TWO separate products:
1. **Process Mining** (for system-level analysis: SAP, CRM, ERP logs)
2. **Task Mining** (for user-level analysis: desktop activities, clicks, keystrokes)

**EPI-Q's Unique Value:** ONE integrated platform that delivers both simultaneously, creating unprecedented visibility from desktop to data center.

**Key Findings:**
- **Market Opportunity:** $2.5B+ process mining + $800M+ task mining markets (converging)
- **#1 Competitive Advantage:** ONLY platform with native unified task + process mining (not add-ons)
- **Target Position:** High Enterprise Governance + High AI/Automation Intensity
- **Pricing Strategy:** Single platform pricing vs. buying 2 separate tools ($500K+ savings)

## 1. TASK MINING vs. PROCESS MINING: MARKET LANDSCAPE

### Understanding the Two Markets

**PROCESS MINING** (System-Level Analysis)
- **Data Source:** Event logs from IT systems (SAP, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Oracle, etc.)
- **What it captures:** System-recorded events, transactions, status changes
- **Visibility:** What happens INSIDE applications (order created, invoice approved, ticket closed)
- **Market Size:** $2.5B+ (2025)
- **Use Cases:** Process discovery, bottleneck analysis, compliance checking, performance optimization

**TASK MINING** (User-Level Analysis)
- **Data Source:** Desktop activity capture (clicks, keystrokes, screenshots, application usage)
- **What it captures:** How users actually work, manual steps, workarounds, context switches
- **Visibility:** What happens OUTSIDE applications (copy-paste between systems, manual data entry, spreadsheet work)
- **Market Size:** $800M+ (2025, growing faster at 45% CAGR)
- **Use Cases:** Automation opportunity discovery, user behavior analysis, training needs, productivity insights

### The Integration Gap: Why Both Are Essential

**Process Mining Alone = Incomplete Picture**
- ❌ Misses 40-60% of work that happens outside core systems
- ❌ Can't see manual workarounds, shadow IT, desktop activities
- ❌ Doesn't capture copy-paste, spreadsheet manipulation, email workflows

**Task Mining Alone = No System Context**
- ❌ Lacks visibility into backend system processes
- ❌ Can't analyze system-generated events, approvals, data flows
- ❌ Misses cross-application dependencies

**EPI-Q: Unified Task + Process Mining = Complete End-to-End Visibility**
- ✅ **Desktop to Data Center:** See user activities + system processes together
- ✅ **Full Process Discovery:** Automated + manual work in one view
- ✅ **True Automation Potential:** Identify RPA + BPM opportunities simultaneously
- ✅ **Root Cause Analysis:** Correlate user behavior with system bottlenecks

## 2. COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS

### Task + Process Mining Capability Matrix

| Competitor | Process Mining | Task Mining | Integration | Notes |
|------------|----------------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| **EPI-Q** | ✅✅✅ Native | ✅✅✅ Native | **✅✅✅ Unified Platform** | **Only true unified platform** |
| **Celonis** | ✅✅✅ Leader | ⚠️ Add-on ($$$) | ❌ Separate products | Task Mining = expensive add-on, not integrated |
| **UiPath Process Mining** | ✅✅ Strong | ✅✅ Separate tool | ⚠️ Loose integration | Two products: Process Mining + Task Mining (separate licenses) |
| **Microsoft (Minit)** | ✅✅ Good | ✅ Desktop flows | ⚠️ Power Automate only | Acquired Minit (task mining) but not fully integrated |
| **SAP Signavio** | ✅✅ Enterprise | ❌ None | N/A | Process mining only, no task mining |
| **Software AG ARIS** | ✅✅ Traditional | ❌ None | N/A | Process mining only, legacy |
| **IBM Process Mining** | ✅✅ Enterprise | ❌ None | N/A | Process mining only |
| **Appian** | ✅ Platform-based | ❌ None | N/A | Process mining only |
| **QPR** | ✅✅ Mid-market | ❌ None | N/A | Process mining only |
| **Fluxicon Disco** | ✅ Desktop tool | ❌ None | N/A | Process mining only |

**Key Insight:** EPI-Q is the ONLY platform with native, fully integrated task + process mining. Competitors either:
1. **Don't have task mining at all** (SAP, IBM, Software AG, Appian, QPR, Fluxicon)
2. **Sell it as expensive separate add-on** (Celonis ~$200K+ additional)
3. **Have two loosely-integrated tools** (UiPath requires both licenses)

**Market Opportunity:** Companies currently buying Celonis Process Mining + Celonis Task Mining pay **$700K-$2M+** for both. EPI-Q delivers unified platform at **$89K-$500K** = **60-80% cost savings**.

---

### 6.2 Go-to-Market Narrative

**PRIMARY Positioning Statement:**
> "EPI-Q is the ONLY unified task mining + process mining platform that shows you the complete picture—from desktop activities to data center processes—in one integrated solution. While competitors force you to buy and integrate TWO separate products (costing $700K-$2M+), EPI-Q delivers both with AI-powered digital twins at 60-80% lower cost. Get complete end-to-end visibility without the tool sprawl, integration headaches, or consulting fees."

**ALTERNATIVE Positioning (AI-Focus):**
> "Stop buying process mining and task mining separately. EPI-Q is the first unified platform that combines both with real-time AI-powered digital twin simulation. See user activities AND system processes together—automate smarter, faster, and cheaper than Celonis + UiPath combined."

**Key Messages (Priority Order):**

1. **"ONE Platform, Complete Visibility: Task + Process Mining Unified"** ⭐ PRIMARY
   - **Process Mining:** System-level event log analysis (SAP, CRM, ERP)
   - **Task Mining:** User-level desktop activity capture (clicks, keystrokes, workflows)
   - **Unified Integration:** See both together in real-time
