## 💬 Common Questions

**Q: Can we start with fewer users and scale up?**  
A: Yes. Start with our standard Enterprise tier ($1,999/mo = 51+ users). When you reach 1,000+ users, we'll transition you to enterprise-scale pricing with retroactive credits.

**Q: Do you offer government/education pricing?**  
A: Yes. 25% discount for federal/state government and accredited educational institutions.

**Q: Can we mix SaaS and on-prem?**  
A: Yes. Hybrid deployment available. Example: Production on-prem, development/testing in SaaS.

**Q: What if we exceed the user count mid-contract?**  
A: We'll invoice the difference pro-rated for remainder of term. Example: Jump from 2,000 to 2,200 users in month 6 of 12-month contract = (200 users × $15/user × 6 months) = $18,000.

**Q: Can we get source code access?**  
A: Yes, available for on-prem customers at additional cost:
- **Escrow:** $50,000 one-time (source released if EPI X-Ray shuts down)
- **Full License:** $500,000 one-time (modify and redistribute)

**Q: Do you support air-gapped environments?**  
A: Yes. On-prem deployment with offline update packages. Requires manual quarterly updates. Additional $100,000 setup fee.

**Q: What happens to our data if we cancel?**  
A: You receive complete data export in standard formats (CSV, JSON, database dump). We retain data for 30 days post-cancellation, then permanently delete.
